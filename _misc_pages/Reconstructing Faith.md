Speaker: Marty Soloman

The central theme of this talk was moving beyond a critical, hurt state of observing what all is wrong with "the church" and into a state of rebuilding communities that do what it was designed to do.

Matthew 5:43-45
- shmikha or rabinnic authority
- Essenes discover the Dead Sea scrolls 
- "Love your neighbor, hate your enemy" was the mantra of the day and Jesus challenged that

Matthew 8:21-22
- spices on dead body ... the intent was to SPEED UP decomposition
- spices would typically sit on the body for 1 year before bones were taken up into ossuaries and kept in cabinets that preserved family closeness
- tomb doors were easy to open but hart to close
- Abrhamam Cohen "Every Man's Talmud" - superstitions surrounding death - similar to Catholicism in this way
- the main idea here is that God's kingdom is greater than man's traditions

Mark 11:15-17
- temple mount
- 2nd temple remodelled by Herod
- wall demarked the line between Gentile/Jew, women/men, etc.
- Jews had decided (perhaps for good reason) that it was a good idea to set up shop in the area that Gentiles were allowed to occupy
- time/place ... engage and think critically to reconstruct

Galatians 2:15-16
- Gentiles who worship G-d called God-fearers or God-worshippers
- Hilel vs Shamai: Justified by faith or by following Torah?
- Justitication is not Salvation

Acts 10
- Peter deconstructing religious tradition

Galatians 2:11-21
- We don't know where the quotations end
- Shamai was the dominate influence in Galatia
- Rome had an arrangement with the Jews ... specualtion that it was Ceasar mis-hearing a proposition from the high priest, who said that every year he would make a sacrifice FOR Ceasar, not TO Ceasar
- Every other Roman citizen had to pay a sacrifice to "worship" Ceasar but Jews had this requirement waived
- FOr the new Gentile Christians, it'd be easier to "become Jewish" because Rome killed non-Jews who refused to worship Ceasar

Stop throwing stones and use them to rebuild the house.

Torah saves me from abusing/misusing/misinterpretting Torah (Gen 15)

Matthew 15:1-9
- tradition of the elders BECOMES talmud
- Jesus is prepping his disciples for deconstruction/reconstruction

Roman patronage
Greek democracy

Being counter-cultural ... the Gospel always finds the power pyramid and flips it
