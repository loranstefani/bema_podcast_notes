- Two camps of thought about Jesus as he related to Jewish culture of his day
    1. Marginal Jew - on the fringes of Jewish society
    2. Mainstream Jew - in the thick of Jewish culture/society

- Elle first walks through 'marginalism'
    - Anti-semetic roots - trying to minimalize Jesus' Jewish ties because "outsiders are bad" mentality 
    - Ways that humans get revelation about God, according to DEI VERBUM (https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html):
        - Scripture (sola scriptura espouses the idea that revelation comes ONLY through scripture)
        - Tradition (we learn about God through the traditions passed down to us)
        - Authoritative speaker (pope, bishops, etc.) - referred to as _Magisterium_ in Catholicism
    - Some discussion around maintaining a posture of humility and openness to learning, even if we do not find ourselves landing in the same camp/tradition as others, there is still something to learn from them
    - Personal revelation should not be above doctrine or scripture, regardless of camp or relgious tradition
- 'Mainstream' is the route most BEMA speakers tend to align themselves with
    - This kind of confused me (Loran), because of past episodes where we learned about the word for what Jesus was perceived as (basically a bastard - I think the word was matzer but not sure), even going so far as to consider that John the Baptist (his cousin) was also acting as Jesus' rabbi becuase he would have not been eligible to be a formal student due to his lineage.  In this teaching, Jesus was very much considered to be on the "fringe" of society.  
    - Talmud was written down after Jesus, but the things written in it hearken back to before Jesus was born
        - Some discussion around whether Jesus' teachings had any influence on what ended up being written
    - Samaritans reject the Talmud, which comes into play later as Jesus was explicit in his interactions with the Samaritans and instruction to preach the gospel to Samaritans
