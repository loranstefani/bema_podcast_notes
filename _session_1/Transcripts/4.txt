His Bow in the Clouds
Brent Billings: This is the BEMA Podcast with Marty Solomon. I’m his co-host Brent Billings. Today we’re joined by Elle Grover Fricks to talk about the story of Noah and the flood and how we have a wide variety of buried treasure from the author.
Marty Solomon: Elle Grover Fricks? What are you talking about, Brent? It's just you and me on this podcast. What are we doing?
Brent: Aha, we are—as foretold in, I believe, BEMA -1, if you listen to that episode—this is a new edition of the BEMA podcast.
Marty: Reboot.
Brent: Marty used to do this every two years and it’s been eight years since we launched the podcast and we’ve learned a few things and we have received your emails and your questions and we’re here to address all of those things. We’re here to improve ourselves, something that we hope everyone is doing over time. And yeah, we’re here to update it and Elle  is part of that update.
Elle Grover Fricks: Hello.
Marty: Yeah, one of the things we did to improve ourselves is we added more people to the team. And so you’re going to meet those people. You’re going to meet Reed and you’re going to meet Josh. But today you start with our first co-host, Elle Grover Fricks. And we’re not doing long intros for these. We’ve done that before.
There’s an episode in Session 6 where you get to meet Elle Grover Fricks, hear her larger story and listen to that episode. I think we’re giving hall passes to everybody but Josh’s episode. Josh’s episode will spoil everything if people listen to that one.
So, yeah, so Brent, put that link in the show notes, but Elle is—what do we need to know if they don’t listen? Elle’s an expert. I mean, we use those terms with just generous, loving hands, but she went and got her, tell—
Elle: Yes! Loosely.
Marty: Tell us about your degree. What did you get your degree in studying, Elle?
Elle: My master’s degree is in the Bible in its ancient Near Eastern context. And I went and got that from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Marty: Elle went and lived my—like I’m living vicariously through Elle. She went and did all the things that I always wanted to do and never got to. So Elle has this wonderful degree that now we get to benefit from on the podcast. She gets to bring that expertise.
So she’ll talk to us a lot about the Hebrew. I’ve learned a lot of my own stuff from Elle. Taught me a lot of things and taught me about the Hebrew language. So that’s part of what she brings. She also has a passion for—did you focus on violence against women in the Scriptures?
Elle: I did. That was the focus of my research; though, I did other stuff.
Marty: Yeah. So if you want to hear about all that other stuff and hear more about that stuff, listen to Elle’s introductory episode. But Brent, we’re not going to do a whole lot of reading today. Is that right?
Brent: Not a ton. This is a pretty big story and we don’t have that much time. As much as that would be fun, I would encourage you to read it in your discussion groups perhaps.
Marty: It’s a story we’re used to. Noah and the Ark. We tell this story to our kids multiple times a year. It’s a lovely little children’s story with the animals and the flannel graph going into the big wooden boat. We are so used to this story.
Elle: Lots of dead bodies on the flannel graph as well.
Marty: Yeah, yeah, we don’t include that. So true.
Brent: You had a different kind of childhood if that’s what your flannel graph looked like.
Elle: Well, you know, again, listen to my intro episode and learn.
Brent: There you go.
Elle: [laughter]
Marty: So, Elle, while you’re already here, you’re already into it. What are the problems? Like we’re familiar with the story of Noah and the ark, maybe a little bit too familiar. What are some of the problems that you see when you get into the story?
Elle: Right. Well, like you said, there’s a lot of lullaby effect going on, at least for me, so that when I read the story, I go, “Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.” But one of the things you might notice is, with its great length, there’s lots of these seemingly random details. They’re very specific.
We have to know how big the arc is and what particular dimensions and how many of each animal, how many clean animals, how many unclean animals, and it makes the whole story stretch on for a long time.
So one of my questions would be, or problems, would be why are these here? Why are these important? Why are they included? What’s going on there? That’s what stands out to me.
Marty: Absolutely. We’re starting to learn that all these details are usually not just here randomly, but they’re here on purpose. And so absolutely good observation. Brent, what problems do you have? See in this story.
Brent: Well, there’s this—just such forceful phrase here near the beginning of chapter six. The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. It’s like, wow. Is it really that bad? Like that sounds, that sounds pretty extreme, right?
Marty: Absolutely, that’s a statement of superlatives there. Is that the right word? Superlatives? Did I say that right?
Elle: Yes.
Marty: Yeah.
Brent: And like, we’re literally about to be told about somebody who did not fall into that. So, so what’s going on there?
Marty: Right. Yeah, so it must not be every inclination of all the people always, because there’s noah. I get that. So yeah, totally. There’s a hyperbolic statement that must be there for some kind of, at the very least, literary effect, if not more.
Brent: And even so, like, this is God’s creation that he was so happy with.
Marty: Totally. Yep.
Brent: So how could he just totally destroy it? Like, isn’t there a better way?
Marty: Right. We’ve been trying to make this case for the last few episodes about God’s good creation and how he feels about it, and he loves it and he believes in it, and he keeps wanting to find people to help him redeem it. And they’re failing, but now God’s just giving up on this. It does feel a little odd.
I remember when we did our first version of this episode years ago, we had one of our students, Kevin, with us. Kevin pointed out when he looked at the story, he said one of his problems was that the corruption of the earth, like there seems to be a specific, like, focus on the earth’s corruption, which feels, that feels weird, right?
So there’s all these problems. And sometimes when we do our problems, sometimes we like to add some historical context to some of these problems too. And so one of the things we want to know as we start to study is that the flood stories were not unique to this ancient world.
In fact, it almost feels like almost every culture around the culture, what we might call the culture of the Bible, all their neighbors had different versions of flood narratives. The flood narrative, the great deluge is so very common in the ancient world of the Bible. And Brent, I don’t know, are you going to have, do you have anything, a link in the show notes you can put in there?
Brent: I guess I could link the Wikipedia article and then you can just follow sources from there. But any, just a basic internet search, you’ll find stuff.
Marty: Yeah, you can just a basic Internet search will fill your mind with all kinds of, and there’ll be a lot of garbage out there on the Internet too, but some of those places where you can go like those Wikipedia articles will give you a summary of some of the things that you might be able to trust a little bit more.
I also know John Walton is a great source. He does a book about the lost world of the flood. We didn’t recommend that the first time around, but Brent, maybe we can throw that link in our show notes.
Brent: Absolutely.
Marty: Yeah, that’ll be a good one. Now, by the way—if all these—I remember when I first learned this, and I remember when I went to Bible college, I argued against this. I said that all these other stories were copycatting off the Bible. They were very adamant about that. When you learn about these stories, it can be jarring.
Like you’re like, “Oh my goodness, I thought the Bible was really, really unique.” And so to learn that there’s all these other cultures telling very similar stories can be a crazy thing to learn about. And then people start to wonder, did this story even happen?
It could be, it’s very possible that all these stories exist because of something called cultural memory. Cultural memory refers to the fact of—all cultures remember this because it really actually happened. A lot of people will talk about, was Avram a real guy or was he made up? Well, he seems to be a real guy because multiple cultures talk about a guy named Avram. He must have, there must be historicity. That’s called cultural memory.
So maybe all these flood narratives exist because there really was a story about the flood. But what we want to lean into here is we want to start realizing the author is purposely retelling and reframing the folk stories that they are used to, the folk stories that they grew up with, the stories that shaped their understanding.
The Biblical author is coming along saying, “Let me retell. Let me invite you to reframe what you assume about the world, about who God is. So one example of this, let’s just do an example. The Epic of Gilgamesh. Elle, you should tell us what you know about the Epic of Gilgamesh.
Elle: The portion of it that talks about the flood narrative is really only on a few tablets, but you can look up translations of these tablets. You can read it for yourself. But I’ve pulled out a few excerpts to kind of underline or highlight what Marty’s talking about where we have these stories that are normative, at least in the ancient Near East, but also elsewhere.
And when we actually do the work of reading them, we can really feel these contrasts about what God might be saying about himself, what God might be saying about us, what God might be saying about the world when we look at it. So I’ve got some excerpts here. The first one is about why the flood happened.
So here’s what a portion of the Epic of Gilgamesh says about why the flood happened. “In those days, the world teemed, the people multiplied, the world bellowed like a wild bull, and the great god was roused by the clamor. Enlil heard the clamor, and he said to the gods in counsel, the uproar of mankind is intolerable and sleep is no longer possible by reason of the babble. So the gods agreed to exterminate mankind.” Super, super juicy stuff. So in this story, what’s the big problem for the gods?
Brent: People are annoying.
Marty: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. There is not a partnership between God and mankind. They are out to destroy this babble.
Elle: Right, right. The people are annoying. Gods have like physical needs. They need to sleep. They’re, we’re kind of like ants, you know. God’s problem, when we read Genesis 6, is evil, right? Violence being done against the earth, being done against people.
This is the concern that causes him to say with the spirit that we’re not going to wrestle through this thing forever. We’re going to come up with a solution. next excerpt that again highlights the difference between the tale, the folklore, and God’s account of himself isn’t so much a contrast about God and who he is versus who we are and how that plays out in folklore, but it’s just a section that might sound super familiar.
If you are not convinced that these things line up exactly or even close to that, just take this little section and see if it sounds familiar. “These are the measurements of the bark as you shall build her. Let her beam equal her length. Let her deck be roofed like the vault that covers the abyss. Then take up into the boat, the seed of all living 24 creatures.”
So in that we’ve got talking about these measurements, which it goes into that I didn’t include, we have a reference to a vault, right? Probably talked about that in the creation episode. And then we have, taking into the boat, all these creatures. So very similar. It’s not just like, “Oh, there was a flood and people escaped or didn’t.” It’s very specific. A God telling a person, “You need to build a boat. These are the measurements and dimensions, and this is what you need to do.” Hopefully helpful.
Marty: Absolutely. You got any other excerpts here?
Elle: I do. One last one that returns to this theme of what’s God’s posture versus what’s the posture of the pantheon in the area. So this one’s about the unleashing of the flood.
This one says, “Nergal pulled out the dams of the nether waters. A stupor of despair went up to heaven when the god of the storm turned daylight to darkness, when he smashed the land like a cup. One whole day, the tempest raged, gathering fury as it went. It poured over the people like the tides of battle.
“Man could not see his brother nor the people be seen from heaven. Even the gods were terrified at the flood. They fled to the highest heaven. They crouched against the walls, cowering like curs.”
Okay, how is that different than how we see God portrayed in Genesis?
Marty: Well, just the dynamic of polytheism versus monotheism stands out here. Like in this polytheistic world, you can have this story where these gods are working against these gods or whatever you might have.
Elle: Right.
Marty: In the narrative, the biblical narrative, we have one God in relationship with creation and Noah, which removes that whole dynamic. But again, this God is like, you can feel the parallels. Here’s a story of God wanting to destroy the earth, very similar stories.
And yet the very next paragraph in the biblical narrative is God saying, “But let’s start a plan to save it,” which is totally different than what you just read of the gods fleeing from this disaster, escaping to the highest heaven. Like this God almost immediately starts subverting his own plan, which is a problem for me in the story. So, totally.
Elle: Right. Yeah, what stands out to me is they seem to have the situation really out of control, right? It says that they’re cowering like curs, they’re running away, they can’t even see mankind anymore on the planet. So it seems almost like a whoopsie daisies of, “Oh, wow, this is bigger than we meant to.” Oh, there’s no sense of that happening in the biblical account.
So perhaps what would have stood out to the original receivers of this story is the idea of monotheism, the idea of God being in control, the idea that God is not annoyed by humanity and their clamor and everything they ask for, but rather a God who is in control, a God who is set against violence, and a God who is quick to want to get things back on the right track for humanity and creation and accomplish some redemption.
Marty: Perfect.
Brent: And like, where is this story from? Like the Epic of Gilgamesh, where does that originate?
Marty: Now, this would be a Sumerian tale. This is Mesopotamia. This is the world of the people of the Bible. Like when we read about Abraham and his descendants, Abraham’s going to come out of this world. So these are the stories that the people of Genesis are familiar with.
Elle: Yes, it says that Avraham is from Ur and Ur is one of the central cities of the kingdom of Sumer.
Marty: Yeah, absolutely. All right, perfect. So they’re used to some of these stories, and yet this story in the Bible is telling them God is not who you thought He was. The world is not quite what you thought. Reconsider. So we have all these problems. We have all the problems we’ve mentioned.
We’ve had the fact that here’s a story of God wanting to wipe out and destroy creation, but He’s not doing a very good job of it. He’s not very good at destroying all of creation. So we have all these problems. Brent brought up this phrase, “Every inclination of the human heart all the time was evil.”
That phrase shows up not just at the beginning of the story, it shows up again at the end of the story. So at the beginning of the story, God’s prompted to action because of the statement. At the end of the story, God will end up saying, “Even if this is true, like even if all the every inclination of that.” So that statement, that phrase shows up at the beginning of the story and that phrase shows up at the end of the story.
Brent: Hmm.
Marty: So that phrase shows up at the beginning of the story and that phrase shows up at the end of the story. I always ask Brent this question, but I’m smelling something, Elle. Like what, do you smell that? What is that? What is that?
Elle: I believe that smells like a chiasm.
Marty: Absolutely it does.
Brent: The delicious aroma.
Elle: Delicious aroma.
Marty: Now, here’s what I love about, we just did potential bookends. If you want to find that statement that Brent made, those are bookends for the chiasm. Here’s what I love about the Noah chiasm. It’s one of the easier chiasms to work with because I can find it by using the numbers. It’s not like unbelievably easy.
You can still get hung up, but you can find it easier than many because of the numbers. So here’s how I’m going to invite you to find the chiasm. In this story from Genesis 6, 7, 8, you’re going to have the number 7. Then you’re going to see the number 7, and then you’re going to see the number 40, Then you’re going to see the number 150.
And then you’re going to see the number 150 again. You’re going to see the number 40. And then you’re going to see a bunch of sevens that are possibilities. Don’t let that throw you.
The chiasm is going to be built off of 7, 7, 40, 150, 150, 40, 7, 7. That will help you find the chiasm. You can take a moment, you could pause this podcast and just go find it because the center verse will be really easy to find. Once you find those 150s, the center verse ends up becoming what, Brent?
Brent: 8, verse 1.
Marty: Can you read it? 8, verse 1, give it to us.
Brent: “But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark and he sent a wind over the earth and the waters receded.”
Marty: He sent a wind. Elle Grover Fricks. What is the Hebrew word for wind?
Elle: The Hebrew word for wind is ruach.
Marty: Ruach. Tell us about this word.
Elle: Ruach is onomatopoeic for breath. There’s a couple of different words in Hebrew that evoke breath. Ruach is one of them. You can kind of imagine the sound, kh-kh-kh right? That end is kind of like an exhale there. But very importantly for theology, it’s also the word that is used for the of God, whenever we see in our Bibles, “and the Spirit of God came upon Saul,” or whomever, whoever is being talked about, it will say, “the Ruach of Adonai came upon so-and-so.”
It’s onomatopoeic, it’s feminine noun, and it can be translated, always, “spirit” or “breath,” because it’s okay to say, “the breath of God came upon Adam. That works too, but that’s the word behind “spirit” and “breath” and “wind.”
Brent: And we talked about this in Genesis 1, right?
Marty: Yeah, well, yeah, this shows up in Genesis 1. Brent’s headed right where I’m headed next. We’ve seen this before.
Brent: Yeah, we talked about it, right?
Marty: Yeah, we did talk about ruach before—we just didn’t talk about with a level of expertise we had in our third chair today, so I wanted to ask her about that. But we did have this conversation where we had ruach over water before, and it was, it was, in the creation story. We also have Noah—He’s going to open up the window of the ark. What’s going to come in the window when he opens up the window?
Elle: Light.
Marty: All right, so we got spirit over water. He opens the window, you’re going to have light come in. The rain has stopped, which means we now have water above and we now have water below. When was the last time I heard all these things? It was in that same creation story. And Rabbi Foreman’s done a teaching where he actually follows like day four, day five, day six.
Everything in the Ark story happens again in the exact same order as the creation story, which means at the end, we should be waiting for Sabbath. Like at the end of this story, we should on some level be waiting, be wanting to see, be wanting to find Sabbath. And right where it should be, we end up getting this really odd passage about them coming out of the Ark, here comes Sabbath, and then this big, awkward paragraph. So Brent, would you read us Genesis 9, let’s say 8 through 17?
Brent: “Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, “I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you and with every living creature that was with you, the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you, every living creature on earth.
I establish my covenant with you. Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood. Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.” And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come. I have set my rainbow in the clouds and will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.
So God said to Noah, ‘This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.’” Did I accidentally read that three times, Marty?
Marty: Yeah, it felt like it, didn’t it? Like, man, you just felt like you were saying the same verse over and over. How many times does that phrase need to be used? Okay, God, I got it. You’re going to make a covenant between me and all the things of the earth? It’s going to be great. Covenant, yep. And he gets on this little tangent about rainbows and clouds. Okay, but then there’s a covenant between man, my goodness gracious, man, there’s a lot of covenants. There’s a lot of earths.
There’s a lot of, and in fact, when I learned this from Rabbi Foreman years and years ago, he pointed out—Rabbi David Foreman, we’ve mentioned him before—he pointed out that there are in fact, four words that seem to keep showing up in this section in a very repeated intentionality. Four words, one of them is the word for covenant, Hebrew word is berit. So covenant shows up seven times in the story.
You got the word ha’aretz—the land, the earth. It’s going to show up seven times in this section. So seven covenants, seven earths, the word anan shows up five times in the heat. That’s the word for clouds. Now, in the English, it’s only going to look like it shows up four times, but there’s actually a—Elle, you can correct me. It’s like a “the clouds are clouding” type of an idea. Like the clouds communing.
Elle: Yep.
Marty: We translate that. There’s actually two anan. If you go to Blue Letter Bible or just look up the anan, you’re going to find five anan’s. So we’ve got seven berit’s seven ha’aretz’es, we’ve got five anan’s, we’ve got three rainbows or just bows. That word is keshet, if I’m right there. I only know that because of your wonderful class, Elle.
Elle: That’s kind of you.
Marty: So, berit’s, ha’aretz’es, covenant, Earths, anan’s. Now, there were odd numbers. There was seven, seven, five, and three. They’re all odd numbers. Brent, I love odd numbers. I know you love odd numbers. What is it about odd numbers that the human—and I think there’s actually—I’ve read science about how the human brain is drawn to odd numbers. What is it about an odd number that we like so much?
Brent: You have a center value.
Marty: You have a center. It’s not just a parallel—a center. Wait, there’s a center? You mean that odd numbers are kind of like little mini chiasms, you could say? You know, what would be really weird is if all of these odd numbers, what if the middle, like what if the fourth berit, what if the fourth ha’aretz, what if the third anan, and the second rainbow—wouldn’t it be weird if the all the middle mentions made up a phrase in the middle of this section? In fact, it does.
Elle: Oh my goodness.
Marty: It does. Right in the middle of this passage, these middle mentions make up the phrase, “Over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant.” “Over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant.” It should be mentioned, by the way, that this bow, It’s not a rainbow. Like there’s no, like in the Hebrew, it doesn’t say rainbow, it just says bow.
Elle: The implement of war—same word.
Marty: It’s a weapon. Now, when you think about a rainbow, if it’s like a heavenly bow, if it’s like God’s bow, which direction is the rainbow facing?
Elle: Upward.
Marty: It’s facing upwards, like back towards God, not as a threatening pointed towards earth, but back towards God.
Marty: We expect to see Sabbath, we said, and here we go in this story, God is going to Sabbath from destroying. The first time we had a creation story, God Sabbathed from creating. And now in this second creation story, a reaffirmation of the creation story, God’s going to Sabbath again, but this time he’s going to Sabbath from destroying,
Elle: Hmm.
Marty: Which would be a good enough, that would be a good enough lesson. Like we could just do the conclusion, take us out of here, Brent. But wait, there’s more!
Elle: Scrumptiousness to beat that.
Marty: Brent, can you read the center of the Noah—read 8:1, that center of the Noah story again?
Brent: “But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals. and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth and the waters receded.”
Marty: All right, putting the lullaby effect aside, Elle, what is it that seems odd about that verse? What’s the odd part that feels like, “What?”
Elle: Surely if God is omniscient, He doesn’t forget anything, and thus how can He remember something?
Marty: Remember, like he had to forget, like, did he forget? Like, “Oh yeah, Noah, the boat. Oh my goodness.” Like, was he distracted? Like, what’s going on?
Elle: Yeah, big oops.
Marty: Yeah, that would be a big oops. But he remembers. It just feels like a weird thing to say. And then here’s that middle statement again. Remember the second little mini chiasm? There was a mini chiasm at the end of the big chiasm. Here’s that center statement again. “Over the earth, the rainbow appears in the clouds. I will remember my covenant.“ Why does this keep being said about remembering when God isn’t going to forget? What is that all about?
Well, the context of these covenants in the ancient world would be something called the Suzerain Vassal Covenant. Suzerain Vassal Covenant. Two different parties. The Suzerain is always the powerful party. We’ve probably heard the word vassal before. my vassal.” For in Game of Thrones or any other fun storytelling, you might be familiar with the term of vassal. Somebody will be somebody else’s vassal.
Brent: I’m not.
Marty: Brent is not, but that term may be one. Suzerain was a term I had very rarely ever heard. I learned about it in the term of biblical context, but vassal was one I was more—there’s a suzerain vassal—there’s a powerful party, the suzerain, and then there’s the vassal, the subject. And as long as you, as a vassal, as long as you serve the suzerain, then you fall under that suzerain’s protection.
You will get a sign of that covenant, kind of proof, like a receipt. And you’ll need to produce that proof, maybe, if the king ever asks, like, “I don’t know. I don’t know if I remember making a covenant with you.” You might have to produce that proof of the covenant, of that relationship. But you will need to have the help of the suzerain.
You will need to be able to prove that relationship, remember that relationship, because you will need the suzerain. And yet God, in this story, says he’s going to keep the sign. He’s not going to give the sign to us. He’s afraid that we might forget it. He doesn’t want us to ever forget it. He’s going to put the sign in the sky for him to remember. If you ever forget, even if you lose the sign, God says, I’m going to remember. I sabbathed from destroying.
So now I go back, Brent, to your phrase that stood out to you. idea that every inclination of the human heart. At the beginning of the story, the beginning of the story, it was God was God regretted because every inclination at the end of the story, it says, even though, which is one of my favorite two words in the preface of Genesis, even though every inclination of the human heart, even though that might be true, even if it is true, even if they go back to every inclination of the human heart being only evil all the time, Even though I will not destroy creation.
This story is in a lot of ways, it feels very counterintuitive. Like what kind of suzerain would give away their leverage? The suzerain has this leverage to keep the vassal in fear, to make sure that you do the right thing. And yet this God in Genesis doesn’t try to leverage fear, doesn’t try to leverage insecurity, doesn’t try to leverage power. Like he gives away all of his leverage because he doesn’t want that kind of relationship. He wants a different kind of relationship.
This story is telling a different story about who God is in the Epic of Gilgamesh. This story is a different story than the stories they’re used to, because God isn’t like the gods that they used to know. And that is one of the fun things about seeing this story. And so often people at the end here, Brent, are going to tell us, “Oh, they’re going to write in and they’re going to say, ‘So wait, did this story happen or not?’”
And we don’t want to get lost in the wrong questions, because this story is inviting us to learn something about who God is, not just tell us about what happened. And I know that doesn’t answer the question. I know that you’re still like, “Okay, but did it happen or not?” And we’re going to try to stay away from those questions and try to lean into the questions that the story seems to be begging us to wrestle with.
So there you go. Episode 4. Elle, you got anything else?
Elle: I have an example of a suzerain vassal situation.
Marty: I love it. Let’s do it.
Elle: Okay, one thing that popped to mind, there are these things called the Amarna letters. You can look them up and they’re a great example that we have historically from this exact region of Suzerain vassal covenants. So the city states that make up Yisrael, the big different city centers dotted across the landscape were in a Suzerain vassal relationship with Egypt. This is before folks crossed over the Jordan. So if you look historically, Bronze Age era.
But we have this huge pile of tablets that are calling upon the suzerain-vassal relationship where the vassal is saying, “Hey, I have given my tribute. I have paid my taxes every single year, and yet I’m still beset by this problem, by bandits, by attackers. I need you, my Suzerain, to come and rescue me, and I’m calling upon you to do that. And I’m reminding you of the covenant that we made together, the agreement that we came to that I would do this for you and you would do this for me.
So we’re familiar culturally with the “Please help. Don’t forget. I’m supposed to do this,” because in that setting, right, if they hadn’t paid their tribute or their taxes, then Egypt wouldn’t have to come and help them out. And here, the “even though” is God saying, “Even when you don’t pay your tribute, you don’t pay your taxes, you don’t levy all of this praise about my greatness, even then the arrow is loosed towards me rather than toward you. And I will yet come and rescue you from yourself, “even though every inclination of your heart is toward evil.”
Marty: I love that. That’s a perfect example. Do we have—is that something Brent can link in the show notes?
Elle: Absolutely. Oh, thank you.
Marty: Woohoo!
Brent: All right, a great expansion of links for this episode. I love it.
Marty: Yeah.
Brent: Elle, you’re a great addition to our learning.
Elle: I’m privileged to be here.
Brent: Yeah, and I think we know that God isn’t like the other gods, but at some point humanity had to learn that and even today like we have we have our own things to wrestle with. So getting to see how God is different and unique in the world is beautiful and we have much to learn, much to wrestle with, many lullabies to break out of.
So if you want to find those links you can go to bemadiscipleship.com and check out this episode. If you want to get a hold of us you can use the contact page on there. Check out the groups page on the website, find some people in your area to wrestle with these questions, form your own group if you want to. But thanks for joining us on the BEMA Podcast this week. We’ll talk to you again soon.
Kirk Doerr: Hello, I'm Kirk Doerr from Kansas City, Missouri, and here is the prayer from Episode 4's Companion.
We bless you, God, for loving us, for pursuing us, and for painting in the clouds a reminder of your promise to us. We bless you, God, for being different, for being the one who partners with us in restoring your creation, your kingdom. We bless you, God, for knowing when to stop.
May we hold this love, this covenant, and this partnership close to us—always. In Jesus’s name we pray, amen.
