A Tale of a Tower
Brent Billings: This is the BEMA podcast with Marty Solomon. I’m his co-host Brent Billings. Today we’re joined by Josh Bossé to talk about the Tower of Babel and some of the observations we’re able to take away from the story.
Marty Solomon: Yes, we are meeting for the first time in this reboot experience. Joshua Bossé. We meet him along with everybody else that we’ve met in Session 6, if that were in the real time experience, we met him in Session 6. So there’s an episode, Brent—what number is Josh’s episode?
Brent: 233.
Marty: 233. If you want to hear the full introduction of who Josh is and the kind—what I mean by that is like who Josh is, but then there’s like who Josh is. How is Josh?
Brent: I will say this though, if you go ahead to listen and figure out who Josh is, after we introduce Josh, stop listening to the episode because the rest of his episode will ruin a story that you’re going to hear in a few episodes from now. So, you know, this is an honor system situation—
Marty: Yeah, that’s true. I forgot about that.
Brent: —but if you want to know who Josh is, go to 233, but don’t listen to that whole episode yet.
Marty: But then you got to stop when we get in—that’s absolutely correct. Boy, I didn’t think about that. You’re right. Yeah. No cheating, everybody.
Josh Bossé: This is a cumulative experience and you have—you need to know how to say enough.
Marty: Ah, yes. I love that.
Brent: Hopefully a lesson that’s still fresh in everyone’s mind as they listen to this right now.
Marty: Absolutely. Absolutely. Josh is on staff with us at Impact. He’s working virtually with college students. And we’ll talk more about that throughout our journey, but if you’re a college student listening to BEMA, Josh is the guy that you would want to know about and get connected with.
Josh: Oh yes.
Marty: Josh is a bit more contemplative, a little bit more like his style is different than Reed. It’s different than Elle. Josh is, I mean, the word mystic comes to mind, but that conjures up all kinds of things for other people. But Josh is well versed in the rabbinic mind and rabbinic traditions and midrash. In fact, he has an email out there somewhere called Midrash Josh. Like, that’s how... That’s a little bit about him, but we won’t dive too far in. We’ll let you listen to that introduction and then stop. But Josh is going to join us today for this and a great story, I think, to join us with. So I’m pretty excited.
Brent: Okay, Marty. I think we should move towards getting into the Text, but real quick, before we get into the Text, we’re just kind of getting used to making this story, this whole portion of Scripture—it’s one story we’re trying to talk about. There’s this flow of what’s going on, God’s telling us this thing. They’re all connected in some way. And so, like, give me a review so we understand, like, as we come into the story, where are we at this point?
Marty: Yeah, absolutely. Like, we’re in a series of stories here. And the story started with the story of creation and how we were invited to trust. But these characters keep pressing on instead of stopping, instead of knowing, I think Josh even was prompting us to know when to say enough earlier. And we were talking about that reference, but that idea of knowing when to say enough, but these characters don’t, like they don’t know when to say enough.
And so God keeps saying, look at this good creation, know when to say enough, but they don’t and they press on in some destructive ways. And we see a wave of that with creativity. We also see a wave of that—we’re kind of in the middle of the wave of destruction. So this knowing when to say enough can be used in either direction. We need to know when to stop creating. We also need to know when to stop destroying. So we’ve seen a series of stories about, hey, know when your creative power needs to be put on hold.
And now we’re in a series of stories about knowing how your destructive power needs to be put on hold and how to hold all those things in check. God knows that humankind is not ready to exercise their creativity in its fullness. They haven’t learned how to trust the story. They haven’t learned how to work for the good of it. That’s going to be a big part of our story today. They haven’t learned how to work for the good of others yet. They’ve only seen how to work for the good of self. And so that’s kind of where we’ve been.
We’ve seen all these stories where God, twice now, God has said, “Creation is good. I’m here for it. Just trust me.” And mankind has went, “I don’t—no thanks. I don’t want to.” And we’re in a series of stories of mankind saying, “I don’t think so. I want to take my power”—and essentially hurt others with it. So that’s where we’re at. So I think that’s a good setup. We should get into the Text.
Brent: Yeah, good context. Let’s get into it.
Marty: Do it, Brent. We’re going to actually start—we need to make sure we get the whole story. So we’re going to ignore that big chapter number.
Brent: Yeah, exactly. We’re going to start in Chapter 10, verse 32, right at the end. But that little pickup is going to be important for the Tower of Babel.
These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent within their nations. From these, the nations spread out over the earth after the flood. Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone and tar for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves, otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If, as one people speaking the same language, they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”
So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
Marty: All right, Brent, I’m going to start with you. We’ve been following this roadmap of starting with the problems, like what kind of problems do we see? So I’m going to start with you, Brent. Do you see any problems with this story?
Brent: Yeah, and this is maybe a little humorous because we’re talking about thinking Eastern versus Western, which, neither one of those is bad. It’s just a different way of thinking that we need to understand. But here, we see them moving eastward, and the direction of eastward seems to be a problem.
Marty: Absolutely. Yeah. And there’s a picture here that I think the reader would do well [to note]. It’s not just the material physical geography they are moving eastward, but I think there’s like a literary, poetic picture in that we’re moving further and further and further away from where Eden was. Like God designed this and we’re heading further and further away from that design. And then, well, I might be getting ahead of myself. Let’s see what other kind of, I would also say like—[Josh begins to speak] go ahead, Josh.
Josh: There’s also a really interesting image attached to that east versus west in terms of directions, because you know back in this time they were Easterners. They didn’t necessarily think of themselves as Easterners as opposed to Westerners, but east and west as images had meaning, because what does the sun do? It rises from the east and goes to the west.
So throughout the Text, east is often a symbol of the past and west is the future. West is where the sun is headed. So we can see a lot of the eastern movement symbolically, maybe as kind of a regression, like wanting to go back to how things were rather than moving forward into the world and the path that God has opened up for them.
Marty: Sure. Right. And along those lines, as it’s moving east, evil is starting to organize itself. If we’ve been following the preface, we had evil was a choice with an individual, then evil was a family between brothers. And then God kind of does the flood, but then evil is, it’s like an entire people group, a table of names.
But now evil is becoming a tower, a city, a civilization, like evil’s gone from being an interpersonal problem to being a societal problem, to now being like almost a—it’s civilizing itself kind of situation in the story.
Josh: Right. That’s a great point, because, you know, we might think that in the flood narrative it talks about everyone doing whatever they want, but that was still very disorganized. Like people were still just individually operating on their own. This is a concerted effort. Yeah like you said, evil is getting organized and that’s that’s scary.
Marty: Right. One of the problems that I saw—just to throw one in here—is that they’re worried about being scattered. That seems like a weird thing to be. Like I would get like, I don’t want to be scattered, but of all the things a story could do, out of these big meta level stories, the one thing they’re worried about is they don’t want to be scattered. And so they want to settle down.
And the story really seems to be in a lot of ways about which if we think about them moving east, if we think about the fact that evil is organized, if we think about the fact they’ve gotten further and further and further away, we don’t want them to settle down.
That actually will be a problem because they’re not settling where God’s design was. They’re settling at the furthest point they’ve been so far in the story. And so that happens to be at play. Brent, what other kind of problems do you see?
Brent: Well, yeah, on that scatter thing, like God does scatter them, but it’s not like he threatens to scatter them before and they’re like, “Oh, well, here’s our solution to that.” Like, where does that worry even come from? That’s weird.
Marty: Right, totally.
Brent: The other thing I noticed is like, how do they have the same language? Because throughout chapter 10, it gives us all of these different nations and clans, and it says that each one of them had their own language. And then here it is, it’s like, well, now the whole earth had one language. It’s like, well, what happened? Everybody was going all over the place, making all these nations. And then somehow, whoop, we’re doing one thing.
Marty: And we actually started one verse too late, Brent, because the verse right before 32 actually is the verse you’re talking about, at least one of them, where it references that they all have different languages, right?
Brent: Yeah, well, it’s most explicitly said the first time in Chapter 10, verse 5, where it says “each with its own language,” talking of the nations. But then after “every son of Noah”, “these are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages.”
Marty: All right.
Brent: And then 31, “these are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages.”
Marty: So it’s an idea that keeps getting repeated, like the text keeps wanting to make a thing out of it.
Brent: Yeah, and then, and then one, you know, two verses later, now the whole world had one language. What?
Marty: Right. But what’s interesting is what’s the verse right after we stopped? So we stopped in verse 9. Read me verse 10 of chapter 11, Brent.
Brent: This is the account of Shem’s family line.
Marty: But read me 10:31 again.
Brent: These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages and their territories and nations.
Marty: All right, so we can clearly see here that the Tower of Babel is a story that kind of exists in the midst of—it’s interrupting a conversation about genealogy. It’s interrupting a conversation about family and table of nations and lineages. The tower, it gets stuck in here in the midst of the story.
So it really is about languages, and yet the story here almost doesn’t belong. It’s getting inserted in the middle of a larger conversation. And that larger conversation is your typical, I would call it a typical table of nations, until it’s not, because it has its own insertions.
Josh, did you, you said you saw a little, like it’s just your regular table of nations until it wants to talk about some dude named Nimrod. What’s that all about?
Josh: Yes, Nimrod. So we didn’t read it, but yeah, in the middle of, I believe it’s, it’s Ham’s line, right? That Nimrod shows up in.
Marty: Yes.
Josh: And it tells us a couple interesting things about him. It tells us that he was the first “mighty man” some some translations will say but in the Hebrew the word is gibor, which has very martial militaristic implications. So this he is the first guy who was a warrior, which that’s interesting. And then it goes on to say that he was a gibor hunter, which to me that’s a weird two things to mush together, a warrior and a hunter, and it even says like he’s a warrior hunter before Adonai, and this is what—this actually just occurred to me. It’s interesting that this whole—what might seem to be a digression about the tower—it could have happened anywhere.
If we’re just saying like oh, it’s interrupting the genealogy; it interrupts it right as it gets to Shem. Right it gets to Shem, and all of a sudden it says, you know—record scratch hold up. Let’s talk about this tower—and I wonder if what we have here is Nimrod this kind of early warrior. We talk about evil organizing itself, and then we hear this you know digression to tell a story about a guy who’s the first ever warrior and he hunts people. This sounds like those two things go together, and I wonder if the reason why we have in this—maybe not the whole earth—but in the land, the word eretz that’s used there in the Hebrew to talk about the whole land had one language. It could be a local area. Maybe they’re saying this guy Nimrod went into Shem’s territory and started conquering people, interrupted the story God is telling through Shem and his descendants to try and make this name for himself to build this tower to have this like kind of an imperial project of like it’s not just the, “I’m gonna beat you up and take your stuff”. It’s like “I beat you up and now I own you, you speak my language. My name is over you, you’re part of me.” Like there is a, it’s almost like Nimrod is trying to take their identity and reorganize them around his ends.
Marty: Yeah. Now, I have to tell everybody, Josh thinks this, but Josh is not the first person to think this.
Josh: Oh man.
Brent: [laughs]
Marty: Like, like, I love how Josh frames this so generously for us, but the Jews have thought about this. They notice this, and we’re not going to dive into all the tradition in the Midrash that surrounds Nimrod because it gets wonky. Would it be safe to say that?
Josh: Yeah, yeah, it’s wild, it’s wild.
Marty: Oh, man. But Josh isn’t just in here in his room, like making up arbitrary things, like these are things that the Jews have also noticed about the way the Text works.
And that’s what we’re trying to do here on this journey through Session 1 is we’re trying to introduce you not just to Eastern versus Western, but we’re also introducing to Midrash here and there, Jewish tradition, because we’re wanting to learn how to read the Bible like the Jewish authors who wrote it, like the Jewish audiences that heard it.
It’s not the only way to read the Bible. But if we can help us understand, they’re seeing what Josh is explaining to us, and they actually have all these traditions around who Nimrod was, and how Nimrod actually led the building project for the Tower of Babel.
Does the text say that directly? No. What Josh is pointing out so well for us is that the Text seems to be saying this potentially indirectly in so many ways that Jews throughout thousands of years had said, “Yeah, these things are connected. Look at how these things are connected.” And that’s how Jewish commentary works.
Brent: And we’re trying to be easy on you guys. We’re not reading through the whole genealogy, but there’s stuff to find in there. And let me read real quick that portion about Nimrod and you’ll see how it connects.
Cush was the father of Nimrod who became a mighty warrior on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord. That is why it said like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord. The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad, and Qalna in Shinar.
And remember: as the people moved eastward they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
Marty: There it is.
Josh: Not only that, in Hebrew, the word there that is translated as Babylon is just Babel. It is literally the same as the name of the tower. Like this, it is not a super crazy stretch to associate Nimrod with this story we’re looking into.
Marty: Yep, nope, not at all. All right, now I remember when I very first heard this, before I even knew half the stuff that Josh even mentioned, before I even knew all the midrash surrounding Nimrod, I was learning this from Rabbi David Fohrman.
We’ve mentioned his name already a few times, but I was learning this through a place he was before there was Aleph Beta, there was a place called the Hofberger Institute. And I was listening to Fohrman in these audio, like—I don’t want to mean “dry” demeaning—but we’re used to like, the fluffy videos of Aleph Beta. The really entertaining, awesome teachings. I was listening to Fohrman in, like, this hours and hours of lecture.
And he was talking about this. And at some point he had a presentation, and I bet it’s probably on Aleph Beta in some form, Brent. I don’t know if we’ll be able to find anything and link it in the episode notes.
But he showed how the pattern of the story of Tower of Babel is playing with the same four Hebrew consonants, the nun, the bet, the lamed, and the, I can’t remember if it was the chet or the he, but N-B-L-H.
And then he kept showing, he would put up the biblical text and he would highlight the nuns—the N’s, the B’s, the L’s, the H’s, if we wanted to say it in the English alphabet.
And then he showed how on the back half of the story, it went H, L, B, N, which is more than just a coincidence. When you have four constants that keep showing up in order, and then reverse those orders and go the other direction, it’s very clear that there’s something, whether it’s supernatural or designed by the author, however you want to view that. And when I say a front half and a back half, Brent Billings, what do we have on our hands?
Brent: We got a chiasm.
Marty: We got a chiasm. And you can even see this, like 11:4 ends up being the center for anybody that wants to see it. Now, let’s say you don’t know your Hebrew consonants, you’re not interested in pulling a blue letter Bible, that gives you a panic attack.
I think you can still kind of see this in the English. Like if you didn’t want to do the work with the Hebrew consonants, because Hebrew is tricky, valuation vowelation marks, all that kind of stuff. If you are into it, go dig it up.
But I think you can see the bookends exactly where we started our story. 10:32 to 11:9, 11:8, 9. To me, I think serve as great bookends. I think you can even see the themes. I think you can see thematically the story moves towards 11:4, and then the story comes back off of 11:4.
Other people might dig up even more connections. I don’t think you have to be a Hebrew scholar to necessarily sense the chiasm. To see it the way that Fohrman is seeing it, you would need to look at the Hebrew consonants. But that means that 11:4 is the center. So give me 11:4, Brent. Read me that, because that feels like a weird center.
Brent: Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens so that we may make a name for ourselves. Otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
Marty: And there’s that theme we already noted, that they don’t want to be scattered. We don’t want to be scattered. We want to settle down. We don’t want to be scattered. Now we’ve already looked at how some of these stories parallel earlier stories.
We looked at how Noah and the vineyard paralleled Adam and Eve in the garden, how the flood paralleled creation. That would mean that this story should parallel what?
Josh: Well, Cain and Abel, naturally.
Marty: Naturally Cain and Abel. Josh, I know you happen to be a fan of the Cain and Abel story.
Josh: Ooh, yes.
Marty: So I love asking you this question. Do you happen to see any parallels between this story and the story of Cain and Abel?
Josh: Yeah, you know, I was just thinking about it, and one that really stuck out to me is, well, you know, of course you have the contrasting image of two different sacrifices that are going up to God’s presence in heaven.
So there’s maybe a parallel there with the idea of the tower reaching into heaven. But what really sticks to me is that the crux of, you know, we have God intervening here. God steps down right after the center, right after 11:4 to see what’s up.
When God steps in in the Cain and Abel story, it’s to warn Cain from going the direction he’s going. And what’s interesting is, that in that context, God warns Cain about sin being at the door, right?
Don’t leave the house and go try and hash this out with your brother Abel in a field. And in fact, in the Hebrew there it seems like maybe they even tried to talk it out but that just didn’t work, and so violence was like the only tool he knew how to deal with a situation.
And here we see kind of the opposite, instead of like it being like, “Hey, don’t go out from the house, stay in your family, hash this out as a family, together, united in community.” Here we see the opposite.
We have this kind of perverse community that is trying to stick together at all costs, and God’s coming down and saying, “Wow, that’s incredible that they’re doing that, like, this is—I’ve never seen humanity do this before,” and he goes, “Whoa, whoa, whoa, y’all need to pump the brakes on this.”
Marty: Right. The parallels that I see to add to that would be Cain was cursed to do what?
Josh: To wander, of course.
Marty: To wander. And here, this story, they’re trying to stop. And what does Cain do at the very, very end of his story? But he builds a city. Like, right after he gets cursed to wander, we’re told he builds a city. Here are these people not wanting to wander and they’re trying to settle down.
So these are both stories about wandering. These are both stories about acquiring like new things like flocks, crops, sacrifices, like you pointed out. Now they’ve acquired the brick. Like both of these are stories of acquisition and wandering. Like those are themes that jump out of both stories. Were you going to say something too?
Josh: Yeah, on top of that, the text makes a point of telling us the name of his city. He names it after his son. And I think there’s probably a connection there between building something, trying to make it permanent, and making a name for yourself, like a legacy that goes on beyond you.
Marty: Yeah, it’s a great point because that was a story about names. Like we focused on the names in the Cain and Abel story. And now again, we have all these parallels. So
the parallels continue. I think that I think we have secured the idea that this is a thing, these parallels.
Let’s see here. Some of my problems that I have with this story, is God threatened by their advances? Like it just feels it just feels weird that God is like, “Oh, like if I don’t do something, they’re going to be able to do anything.” Like, is God really concerned that this tower project is going to work or it just seems weird. Of course, now that I’ve heard some of the thoughts from Josh on Nimrod, I feel like maybe that might make some sense, Josh, yeah?
Josh: Yeah there’s definitely a connection there and actually I just double checked this on blue letter. Apparently according to Gesenius the name Nimrod means rebel, so it feels like maybe there is more going on here than just Nimrod wanting to have it all and sit on top of the hierarchy and be the very best.  
Marty: Right. My other thought is that—my other problem is, why doesn’t God want them to accomplish anything? That felt weird. Like if I don’t do something, they’ll be able to do anything they want. And I’m like, wait a minute, I thought we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. I thought God would want us to accomplish it. And now He doesn’t want us to.
But now when I start to put these things together, if Nimrod is either literally or metaphorically rebel, if he is organizing evil, if they’re trying to settle far, far eastward from where God’s intent was, this isn’t that God is necessarily threatened by their advances, but we actually have a situation where it’s like, “I don’t want you to settle here because I want, I’m trying to get you back. I’m trying to bring you back to my intention. You’re getting further and further away, and I’m not going to let the story end here. I need to get you back essentially to the garden.” I don’t mean that literally, but in a poetic sense, I need to get you back west. We need to go west, young man, as the good Michael W. Smith song said.
Brent: What was the garden? What were we trying to accomplish with the garden?
Marty: Yeah, that shalom, that wholeness, that stewardship, that partnership with God, right? Trusting the story, like they’re not trusting the story. They’re kind of doing the opposite, like Nimrod’s the opposite of trusting the story. Everything they’re up to, he’s trying to get them back to that good creation, partner with me, tree of life kind of imagery.
So I think it’s time to start pulling this thing together. We’ve done the Fohrman thing, like we’ve pulled out all these problems, we’ve noted a chiasm, we’ve got a treasure. Let’s start trying to tie some threads through all of this.
First of all, this story is about technology. It’s about a new technology. Like they have never had the brick before this story apparently. They’ve had stones, you can build buildings with stones, you can stack stones, but it’s kind of hard to find stones that are the same size. They’re not shaped real squarely. It’s just harder to build stuff with round stones.
But now they made the brick, and this is square and you can build higher, you can build stronger. And what I find so interesting is God’s response when they build the brick. We need to introduce people to a literary device here. Brent, there’s a paragraph where they build the brick. Can you read that for me?
Brent: Yeah, it’s verse 3. They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone and tar for mortar. Keep going?
Marty: Go ahead and keep going.
Brent: Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves”
Marty: Stop! Stop.
Brent: Okay. [laughs]
Josh: [laughs]
Marty: There’s a phrase there that happened at the next part where it was, “And they said.” So they said, “Let us build bricks.” They do bricks. “And then they said.”
And in the Hebrew, when you have a series, a discourse, a series of dialogue, and you have a character that says something, and they get done saying something, and the next phrase is, “And they said.” There’s a Hebrew principle that what that means is that there was a break in the conversation. If it’s a seamless conversation, you wouldn’t repeat the phrase, “And they said.”
But there’s a break, and whenever that happens, it means that there was a break and nothing happened. So they make the brick and God says, “… cool.” Like He says nothing. He has nothing to say to the—the brick—here’s my point. The brick and the technology isn’t the problem. They can probably do wonderful things with the brick.
Think about the internet. The internet’s a crazy place. It can kind of be a messy place out there on the internet. But think about all the good that can be done with the internet. That has been done with the internet. Think of all the all the bad that’s been done with the internet... Technology isn’t the issue. Technology is, what would we say, amoral? It’s what we do with it. How are we going to use this?
Are we gonna use this to build God’s world, God’s way? Are we gonna use this to... Are we gonna trust the story with our... But technology isn’t the problem. It seems to be the next... Go ahead and finish off that paragraph, Brent.
Brent: Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves. Otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.
Marty: Okay, so that is what gets God’s attention. Technology itself, God was like, “Interesting. I’m watching. I’m interested. What are you going to do with this?”
And then when he sees what they’re going to do with it, that’s when God all of a sudden gets involved in the story. It’s how they’re going to use it. And if this is Nimrod, Josh, right?
Josh: Yeah, this is where I jump in and you know you talked earlier about how big of a deal you know I mean bricks are not very Revolutionary to us today, but you know we think about like the three little pigs and if you were used to having a house made of straw or a house made of sticks. You know, slapped together with mud. You know, when you ask, “how do you use it?” When I think about, like, “oh me and my friends invented bricks?”
I think “Oh, we’re gonna build better houses. They'll be able to withstand weather better. Maybe they’ll be more energy efficient, it’ll stay warmer in the cold times.” All that stuff.  But no, they have these bricks and they say “let’s build a tower”. And that doesn’t seem like something that is for everyone. I mean even just in the image of a tower; there’s kind of a distinct hierarchy. Someone gets to be at the very top. But you know, I when I used to read this my question was always like “Why a tower?”
Like even stepping into Nimrod’s head and assuming he’s the kind of the mastermind the guy overseeing all this— Why does he want to build a tower? Like is it a defensive thing? There’s lots of plausible explanations, but when I think about where we have just been in the Text and especially when I think about trust and mistrust. We just had a big old flood and then God said, okay, I’m never gonna do that again.
Now if I’m Nimrod and I am not gonna leave that alone, I want to be in control of my life, of my destiny, of my legacy. I want to make a name for myself. I want to force other people to do what I say, and think like I think. All that stuff. When I think of a tower, I think “Oh, hey, maybe if I just build something high enough the flood can’t get me, God can’t get me up here.” Like I literally wonder if this is his way of saying “I’m gonna build a kingdom so strong that not even God can knock me down.” Like, to me, that is what this is saying.
He starts by conquering people and then he thinks “Well, you know, no one here on earth can defeat me, but God could get me. Let’s take this technology. Stop building your brick houses you peons, build a tower for me so that you know, I can live forever.”
Marty: Yeah. You know, the thing that Fohrman taught about this that I found so striking is Fohrman is like, “You know, when God scatters them, it’s not a punishment.” And I was like, “What? Of course it’s a punishment, they’ve done something wrong.”
He’s like, “Eh.” They’re about ready to do something wrong. They’re trying to do something that we would probably say is wrong. But the scattering of humankind is not framed in the Hebrew story as a punishment. It’s framed as a strategic move on God’s part, because if I don’t do something, they’re going to be able to do whatever they set their heart to. And right now, what they want to set their heart to is not constructive. It’s not going to bring shalom. It’s not focused on loving other people.
And so, and of course, Fohrman points out the Hebrew word for Babel means confusion, disorientation. It’s not a curse. The scattering is not... There’s no “curse” in the story of Babel. There’s just a “situation”. God puts them in a position where they will only be able to accomplish–Notice he didn’t take their ability to accomplish amazing things away, but he put them in a position where they were only going to accomplish amazing things if they are able to care and work for the good of others, because now they speak different what, Brent Billings?
Brent: Different languages.
Marty: Different languages. And the thing about speaking different languages is the only way I can learn a language is to completely empty myself, start from scratch, and learn from somebody else.
And if humankind is not going to be ready to do that, then God says they won’t be able to accomplish anything. But if humankind ever decides that they want to learn how to listen and how to speak somebody else’s language, were you thinking something, Josh?
Josh: This just reminded me of the review, like the idea that, you know, here we see this really balanced—like in some sense God is destroying this little empire that Nimrod’s created, but he didn’t, you know, send a lightning bolt down onto the tower or anything like that.
This is a very, like, you know, talk about knowing how to say “enough”, like this is a very gentle kind of nudge in the right direction, just kind of pulling out this linchpin of “Well, if they didn’t speak the same language, this would fall apart pretty quick and then they’d have to stumble into some better coping mechanisms with life rather than this whole tower project.”
Like it’s very, it feels like a really interesting insight into, you know, what God means, you know, when we’re talking about this idea of saying “enough” and knowing how to use our creativity; and our capabilities for destruction as well; to take apart the ways that evil kind of crops up and builds up. And I think that’s kind of remarkable, especially coming out of the flood destruction.
Marty: And feels super relevant, at least for those of us in an American, maybe Christian or not, but an American context where our culture and our society is so—and I’m sure this is true for others, non-American cultures as well for all of our listeners in international settings—But we, especially here, we are so easily polarized.
We are so easy. We get into our tribal groups. We have enemies. There is us and there is them. And the lesson here of the Tower of Babel is as long as there is heavy lines about us and them, just enjoy being scattered all over the earth.
But if you ever want to learn how to listen, how to learn from each other, how to love your enemy, I think Jesus would say. If you ever want to learn how to break down some of those walls. I’ll read some notes that I have from a long while ago.
It’s interesting to note how in order for humanity to continue to progress as a whole, they will need to learn the language of others. You cannot learn the language of another culture or people without learning something about their perspective.
Learning the diversity of perspectives always provides one with a sense of pause and consideration. It requires a sense of learning how to control one’s desires in order to reach a common goal together.
In the confusion of Babel, God has not so much slapped our hands as he has given us a new redemptive project that will cause us to be people that grow into the kind of humanity that bears his image. A humanity that knows when to say enough, a people that trust the story, a people that just might find a place of rest together with those who aren’t like them.
I just love that. I know that in years past, I have taken a lot of assessments, whether it was for getting hired at Impact or planting churches. And the one thing that has been consistent, gentlemen, in all my assessments, is I get low scores for teamwork. I just don’t like group projects.
And it’s because I haven’t learned the lesson of Babel. Like I don’t like to put my own agenda, my own task, my own stuff aside long enough to to listen to what somebody else is working on, to help them out. I just want the whole group to leave, go somewhere else, and I’ll get my task done. Thank you very much.
And there’s something that God knows that we’re not going to be able to accomplish if we don’t learn that lesson. So I don’t know if you guys have any other thoughts to close before we get out of here, but those are my closing notes.
Brent: I would just note that in the original version of this episode, eight years ago, you said the same thing and it continues to be a struggle. We have these same struggles and we have to continually remind ourselves of these stories in these lessons because it’s very hard to change.
Josh: Yeah. And I love that point, Brent, and I want to jump on it and remind us all like this is, uh, you know, the interruption in the genealogy of Shem who ends up being, you know, the, the line of Noah that produces the, the patriarchs and everywhere that the story is going. And like, this is, this is big stuff on like a humanity scale.
This is something we work out sometimes through generations. And, um, yeah, it’s not, it’s not just some small, easy lesson that we just fix and then move on with our lives. Like these are problems with a large scale and so it behooves us even more to work together and really learn what the problem is in our own hearts and how we can build something better, move west, move forward in this beautiful, wonderful creation.
Marty: God knew what he was doing. I got a picture of this being God’s “hold my beer” moment. Like, he was like, “Hold on, watch this.” I’d imagine the divine council, all the angels getting around God like, “Uh-oh, this is going south in a hurry.”
And God’s like, “Oh, no. Check this out. Watch this.” And we’ve been working on this project for quite a long time. So good work, God. We’ve got some work to do.
Josh: [laughs]
Brent: Okay, well I think that’s enough for this episode. Go to bemadiscipleship.com, check out the show notes, there’s a couple things in there.
I don’t know if I’m going to be able to find a video on the Tower of Babel and the consonants. If I find it, it’ll be in the show notes. I don’t, who knows? So don’t be surprised if that’s not there, but the show notes will be on the website.
And also, if you want to get with a group of people and start wrestling through this together, figuring out what it means to commune with people who are not like you, people who don’t speak your language, find a group. So go to the groups page on the website. If there’s no group in your area, we’ll help you start one.
You can use the contact page to get in touch with us. All that’s on the website. But thanks for joining us on the BEMA podcast this week. We’ll talk to you again soon.
Lance Williamson: Hello, I’m Lance Williamson, a BEMA listener in Angola, Indiana, and here is the prayer from Episode 6’s Companion.
God, there are moments where I am drawn east—further away from the plot of The Story and what you’ve called me to do in the Kingdom. Scatter my pride and worries so I may learn, again, to rest and to stop.
Knock down the towers and walls I’ve built to protect myself so we can work to build a longer table for us all, where we can listen and laugh and learn from each other.
I am your partner in putting the world back together. Forgive me, God, when I forget. Amen.
