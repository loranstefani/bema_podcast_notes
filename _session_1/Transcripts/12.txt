A Mission Realized
Brent Billings: This is the BEMA Podcast with Marty Solomon. I’m his co-host Brent Billings. Today we’re covering the life of Isaac as seen in Genesis 24 and 26 where we begin to see the initial realization of God’s promise to Abraham.
Marty Solomon: Yeah, we’re transitioning from the narrative of one patriarch to another. We’re in the middle of the story of the family of God. And I’m going to try to keep the time on this episode down a little bit so we won’t do much more of a review than that, but don’t worry, we’ll probably be back and review business next episode.
But we’re going to look at the life of Isaac. We’re going to keep kind of coming right out of the life of Abraham—Avraham. We’re going of Abraham getting a wife for his son Yitzhak. That has not happened yet. And Sarah has passed at this point. Is that correct? Did I get this right, Brent? Sarah’s passed. She died in Chapter 23.
Brent: Yeah, the whole chapter was about her death in 23, so we’re right on the heels of that.
Marty: Yep. Alright. So we’re right on the heels of that. And I think we should dive in, Brent.
Brent: Okay, Genesis 24. Abraham was now very old and the Lord had blessed him in every way. He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, ‘Put your hand under my thigh. I want you to swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living, will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.”
The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?” “Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said. The Lord, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father’s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, “To your offspring I will give this land. He will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.” So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
Marty: Put his hand under the thigh, Brent Billings.
Brent: Yeah, what is the “hand under the thigh” business? It’s a strange phrase.
Marty: Absolutely. I remember when we recorded this years ago, you’re like, is that like a pinky promise? And I think that’s still one of the funniest lines that we have in the BEMA catalog.
But yeah, so they have in the ancient world, often if you wanted to make a promise, one of the things you could swear that promise by is the authority of a covenant, kind of make this promise on a covenant. And you would usually do that by holding onto the covenant, putting your hand on the covenant, whatever the sign of the covenant is, you would hold that while you make the promise.
And so obviously Abraham’s sign of his covenant is, we see a circumcision. So the thigh can often be thighs, feet can often be euphemisms for the groin area. And so whether they literally are doing that, it wouldn’t be a sexualized thing at all, but whether or not it’s just the expression that’s being used, or whether that’s the idea behind that is swear by the covenant, swear by this thing, this agreement that we have with God, the people that we are. So yeah, pinky promise. Yeah. call it that. I like that. I like that.
Brent: Yeah, well, even if you take it literally and just think it’s the thigh, that’s still pretty weird in our culture.
Marty: Sure it is. It would be weird enough.
Brent: Anything beyond that would be even more unusual.
Marty: Yeah, that’s right. So that’s the idea of covenant oaths. And Abraham is like, he’s sending Eliezer, and he doesn’t have a whole lot of options. Like he doesn’t want them to marry into this pagan idolatry and the pagan narratives of the world around him and the Canaanites, but he doesn’t have a whole lot of options with this.
He has to go somewhere else in the house of his father, the house of Terah. And so he’s got his beit av. I believe we’ve talked about beit av at this point, beit av, the house of the father. But he needs to find another beit av that’s a part of the larger, what’s called mishpucha. The mishpucha is the family.
And in Hebraic thought, I didn’t necessarily understand it this way, but I’ve now read three different textbooks within the last year, year and a half, that have all said the same thing. The mishpucha in the Hebrew concept is the larger extended family.
The beit av is your father’s house. It’s the physical house that you live in. It’s still a bigger house than we’re used to. It still probably has, you know, whatever brothers and maybe even nephews and nieces or whatever that live within your beit av.
Brent: Bigger house in the sense of the number of people living there, not necessarily physical size.
Marty: Right, absolutely. And that beit av can still represent your ancestors, like your beit av came from the beit av, which came from the beit av. But the larger extended family that’s not in that physical proximity would be a part of your mishpucha. So the house of Terah ends up becoming the larger mishpucha, the mishpucha of Abraham.
And so Abraham’s beit av has to go find somebody else in the mishpucha and their beit av and the servant. And I got to be careful here because we, I ended up learning some things later, Brent, and I can’t mess up the BEMA journey. But we will circle back to this story in Session 6, because I learned, it’s probably my favorite episode I’ve ever recorded to date. And I learned some juicy stuff.
So we will end up coming back later in our journey to this story. But Abraham has this commitment. Eliezer’s like, “Listen, this is a big ask. Like what if this woman doesn’t want to come leave her beit av? And what if she doesn’t want to come leave that and come join your beit av? Can I just take Isaac to go be with them?”
And Abraham is like, “Absolutely not. There is a thing that God is doing with our beit av, with our family. There is a promise that we belong to a calling. I’m so sure of this, Eliezer, that God is going to provide. He’s going to go ahead of you. His angel is going to go ahead of you. He’s going to provide what we need. I’m so sure of it, that if God doesn’t provide, you’re free from your...
And as I read it, Brent, I don’t know if this is like just free of the bond that he has to this job, this task. I read it as he’s free from servitude. Like God doesn’t do this. Listen, you just have your freedom. Don’t even worry about coming back home. I’m so sure that God is going to do this for us. Do not take my son back there.
Brent: Is his role as a servant—like is that unusual for him to be doing this for Abraham as a servant instead of another family member?
Marty: Yeah, in some ways, he does have a unique role. Now, this wouldn’t necessarily be typical of any old beit av, but Abraham’s beit av, we’ve been told, is really large. Like we had 318 people earlier in the Genesis story. We have a large estate. He came out of Egypt with a lot of wealth, we were told about. So when you get a beit av or an estate that is that large, you’re definitely going to have a chief servant. He’s a head servant.
And we even remember in Genesis 15, where Abraham refers to him multiple times in different stories, he refers to him as this chief servant, so much so that that’s where his inheritance was going to go. Like Eliezer is this chief without, before there were sons, he was the next highest ranking male in the larger beit av. And so that’s his, his role is to basically, he’s the keeper of the estate. He’s going to make sure that everything’s taken care of, that all the business is settled.
He’s basically going to run the household of, think of Joseph in the story of Potiphar. We’re getting ahead of ourselves, but think about that. That’s the same kind of role that Joseph would have had in the Potiphar household. That’s what Eliezer is to Avraham. So if you’re good, how about we keep on moving with the next few verses here?
Brent: Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master’s camels, loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram-Naharim and made his way to the town of Nahor. He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town. It was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.
Then he prayed, “Lord, God of my master Avraham, make me successful today and show kindness to my master Avraham. See I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. May it be that when I say to a young woman, ‘Please let down your jar, that I may have a drink. And she says, “Drink, and I’ll water your camels too. Let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”
Marty: Alright, so Eliezer gets to this town. He’s got with him ten camels, we were told, all loaded down with... This is a world of dowries and bride prices and gifts that you give. So he’s loaded down. Abraham had, we just said a moment ago, has got a lot of wealth. So he’s got a whole lot of gifts with him, ten camels worth. And he’s got this request.
He gets there and he has—now I don’t think we appreciate the prayerful requests that Eliezer has. He’s basically saying, “God, I don’t want to just pick any girl. I want to know that that’s the right girl.” And so his request is crazy. I have been taught in the Middle East.
The Bedouins say that if you have a thirsty camel, it will take anywhere from 10–20 trips down into a cistern to water a camel. So if you have a thirsty camel, how many camels did he have, Brent?
Brent: Ten camels.
Marty: Ten camels. So he’s asking, “God, I want to make sure I’m picking the right woman. So when she comes out, I don’t want her to just offer me a drink. I want her to offer to go down into a cistern 100 to 200 times on her own. I’m not going to ask her to do it. I want her to offer it voluntarily to do that work and not the work. I don’t want to focus on the work here.
What he’s looking for, and we’ll talk about this more. He’s looking for a particular kind of person. And I wonder if he says this because he’s, you know, I don’t know if he has any other motives when he makes this prayer. Abraham said that, you know, God was going to provide somebody, and if He doesn’t provide somebody, I’m free from this oath. So let’s just make this as hard as it possibly could be.
Like this request in a lot of ways, it’s just absolutely ridiculous. Brent, you’ve been down in one of these cisterns. I’ve taken you on a few different trips and you’ve been down in one of these cisterns more than once. What would that trip be like 100 times?
Brent: I mean, it's not bad going down there once, but yeah, especially carrying a jar full of water. I can imagine that’s quite the deal, even for one camel.
Marty: Yeah, there’s going to be quite a bit going on here. So let’s see.
Brent: Well, I want one question. So this isn’t—this is an old movie at this point—but the Bourne identity, are you familiar with that?
Marty: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Brent: You know how when he’s—when he first wakes up and doesn’t even know who he is. Sitting in that cafe with that guy. And he’s like, I don't, I don't even know my name. But I can tell you all the cars that are in the parking lot. I can tell you all these people I can tell you I can run this much.
Like when she comes in, is she paying attention to everything around her? Like does she know before he asks that he has ten camels? Is he like the talk of the well because you know, he rolls in with all this stuff? Or is she just like, Yeah, I don’t care what you have. I'm gonna be generous regardless. Like what do you think is going on there?
Marty: You know, that’s a great question. It’s not going to be some ten camels loaded down with goodies is not going to go unnoticed. So does she know about that before she even shows up when she shows up? I can’t imagine. It’s still a huge thing she’s willing to do, but you’re absolutely right. This is not something that you would not notice this guy here from out of town with ten camels loaded down with stuff.
And I just happen to be somebody who’s, you know, of age and available for marriage and, you know, that kind of stuff. Do they even know who he is? When he shows up, like, does the town even know? This is one of our, this is one of our mishpucha. This is one of our extended kin, like his servant, maybe not he, but he’s a part of one of our kin’s household. Like, who knows what they know? Yeah, absolutely. It’s a great, that’s a great point. I do love the very next phrase. Like, just give me the next phrase.
Brent: Before he had finished praying,
Marty: See he can’t even get the prayer out and God’s like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it, got it, got it.” She’s right there.
Brent: [Laughter]
Marty: One of my favorite parts of this passage is he has like this ludicrous checklist. Not an extensive checklist, but a pretty, like, crazy, “This is who I’m looking for, God. I’m looking for this person willing to do like crazy, outlandish—and I’m not going to ask for it. She needs to volunteer.” “Shut up, shut up, shut up. She’s right there. Right there. Right there.”
Brent: (laughing)
Marty: Well, go ahead. Go ahead and keep going.
Brent: So good, so good. Before he had finished praying, Rebecca came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milca, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. The woman was very beautiful, a virgin. No man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again. The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.” “Drink my Lord,” she said, quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. 
Maybe this is the point where she’s looking around counting the camels as he’s taking the drink.
After she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels too until they have had enough to drink.” So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful. When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a becca and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.
Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.” And she added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.” Then the man bowed down and worshipped the Lord, saying, “Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Avraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the Lord has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”
Marty: Yeah, so Eliatzer has this response like, “Goodness gracious, my master was right. Like Eris, God has provided.” Can’t even believe that this says, and we’re not going to read the rest of the story for the sake of our time in the episode today, but I would encourage us all to read the rest of this chapter. I think there will be some relevant little nuggets that are going to show up in the gospels that are relevant to some things that Jesus teaches and says there.
So don’t just skip it with us. sure you read it when you have an opportunity and always catch up on these stories. But Eliezer has this outlandish prayer and he focuses on the kind of people. This prayer is saying, I don’t think Eliezer is just trying to come up with some random, you know, I want to make sure I pick the right person to make sure it’s like, you know, a person with shoulder length brown hair and like random details.
He’s asking for something very, very specific. I have watched my master’s house. I’ve watched who he is. I’ve watched his character and integrity. I’ve watched this family. I know what they’re about. I know about their character. He’s asking God to provide, if I’m going to pick a wife for my master’s son, she’s got to be committed to the same stuff that this family... She’s got to come from the same... She’s got to have the same spiritual DNA.
What is he asking for? He’s asking for somebody who’s committed to hospitality. We’ve seen Avraham’s family radically committed to hospitality. We’ve watched him run right after his circumcision surgery. He runs to greet three visitors and take care of them and 60 pounds of flour.
He’s asking for that same kind of hospitality, that same kind of care for the stranger and the outsider, somebody you don’t know, somebody that you don’t owe. You don’t owe them anything. But there’s somebody you don’t know and they’re visiting and they could be in need and he’s asking for this radical hospitality and that’s there. Like it’s a part of this larger family.
It seems that even Avraham’s father, Terah, that must have been a defining mark of who this family that Avraham comes out of. He got it from somewhere. It didn’t just start from him. It’s a part of this larger mishpucha. a part of this larger family of Torah that has the same spiritual stock and DNA. And they’re going to be different, like they’re not the exact same folks as Avraham. We see that all throughout the story.
In fact, we’re going to actually have another episode in Session 6, where we come back and circle back to the story again, just to look at the family and what happens when Eliyahu stays there and they have dinner. But the family shows the same kind of hospitality. “Let me get fodder for your camels.
I mean, no sit and eat and stay and dine and keep staying and keep dining and be with us and the same kind of hospitality. And notice that of all the things he could have asked for, that’s what he’s asking for. Like this is the defining characteristic of Avraham as Eliezer sees it. This is what the family is about, taking care of the outsider.
Brent: And she doesn’t have to go home and check. She just knows, “Yeah, we’re ready to be hospitable.”
Marty: Great point. Totally, 100%. And so that’s what we see about Rivka and who she is. And so then we have Genesis 25, and I want to skip a little bit ahead. Obviously, she makes it back. Isaac and Rivka, they get married, he takes her into his mother’s tent, we’re told, and the story will continue a chapter later. So I’m going to jump ahead to Genesis 26, and pick up where we kind of follow the life of Isaac in the next part of his life.
Brent: Now there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time, and Isaac went to Abimelek, king of the Philistines in Gerar. The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Live in the land where I tell you to live. Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you.
For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands. And through your offspring the nations on earth will be blessed. Because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions. So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
Marty: Alright, so we read about another famine. We’re told specifically it’s a different famine than the famine of Isaac’s father, Abraham. And we know what Abraham did, and God shows up and says, “Hey, don’t do what your dad did. You stay here. Your dad was great.” Story moves forward and God reiterates the mission, like he tells them again, “This was the promise I made. This is the covenant that I’m working through. This is what I was going to do through your dad, and now I’m going to do through you.”
So he reiterates and even kind of expands on the mission of God. God shows up and says, “But I need you to not go down to Egypt. I need you to not repeat that past mistake. So I need you to stay here.” And Isaac, we’re told, does. He stays there. He doesn’t go down to Egypt. He stays where he’s at. He’s leaning into the promise. He’s leaning into the mission, maybe, of the family. I wonder if he’s going to be perfect. We’ll have to find out. Let’s keep on reading.
Brent: When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought the men of this place might kill me on account of Rebecca, because she is beautiful. When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek, king of the Philistines, looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife, Rebecca.
So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife. Why did you say she is my sister?” Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.” Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? The men might well have slept with your wife and you would have brought guilt upon us. So Abimelek gave orders to all the people, anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
And I’ll just note the pronunciation of that name is probably more like Abimelek.
Marty: Yep, it’ll be A-vee-MELL-eck.
Brent: But I just was not confident enough as I started, defaulted to the other way. So just a note in case you’re wondering.
Marty: Absolutely. Elle would say, “Say it confidently.” Yeah, absolutely. So we have this, we have Isaac not doing what his dad did, but also doing what, Brent?
Brent: Pretty much the exact same thing.
Marty: [laughs] He didn’t go down to Egypt, but he still got, yeah, he still did what his father did. He’s the same as his father. He’s also different.
Brent: His father didn’t get caught caressing his wife.
Marty: Yeah, absolutely. By the way, did that story happen once in Abraham’s life?
Brent: No, twice.
Marty: Happens twice in Abraham’s life. First time was where? Where was he?
Brent: To Egypt.
Marty: He went down to Egypt and Pharaoh. Then the second time is with who?
Brent: Oh gosh. I don’t know.
Marty: We go to Genesis 20. Brent, look at Genesis 20 and tell me who this happens with for his dad.
Brent: That’s hilarious. I actually already have a tab open with Genesis 20. Apparently I was looking for something else and had it sitting right in front of me this whole time. Live between Kadesh and Shur… For a while he stayed in… Garar. Right where Isaac is now.
Marty: Yep, same place. And who’s the king?
Brent: Abimelek.
Marty: Abimelek. So either we have it’d be very common for a son of the king or even a grandson of the king to have the same name, especially a name like Abimelek. That means my father is king.
So if Abimelek’s father was a king named Abimelek, because his father was a king named Abimelek, because—I mean, it could be different guys. I’m not trying to say it’s the exact same guy.
But we’re likely working with the same family, if not even the same exact guy who’s like, I know this family. I know their ways. They’re going to keep telling me that these women are their sisters, but they’re actually wives. This has happened to me before.
Brent: Yeah, Genesis 20 says, “Abimelek, king of Gerar,” and 26 says, “Abimelek, king of the Philistines in Gerar.” So I wonder if that’s like an indication that it’s not the exact same person, but I don’t know.
Marty: Okay. Sure. And it could easily be a descendant and even maybe not even a literal descendant, but probably the same group of people. They may know these stories. Isaac probably knows the story of maybe it doesn’t. Maybe Isaac never knew what happened with his dad. Who knows?
But Isaac’s story definitely seems to be mirroring his father. Um, which on one level, we’re going to do some other stuff with that here in a moment, but on one level, I just like to pause and I just like to say, man, that’s somewhat comforting that Isaac, these patriarchs are a lot like you and me.
Like how many of us repeat the same sins of our parents, even when we don’t want or even like, “I’ll never do that. I’ll never be like my parents.” And then we find it, like, in, we find it in our own story. We find it in who we are, like it’s baked into our own spiritual DNA. And the same is true for these biblical characters.
They’re not unusual. They’re not unlike us. They are in a lot of ways, just like us. And I take some solace in that. I hope our listeners do too. Isaac is like you and me. He repeats the sins of his parents. He also repeats some of the victories.
He has some of the same obedience. He has some of the same faith that his dad has, but his story is starting to look like and mirror his father, Abraham. So give me the next verse, Brent.
Brent: Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold because the Lord blessed him.
Marty: Alright, so there he is, he stays in the land and is blessed. We’re told that there’s a famine. God says, don’t go down to Egypt. We’re told that he doesn’t. And then later after the Abimelek story, we’re told again that he stays.
So the story really wants to make a point of the fact that he’s not leaving, he’s not putting his faith in Egypt, he’s staying, and God ends up taking care of him, apparently in some pretty big ways. He stays and he is blessed. Go ahead and keep going.
Brent: The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy. He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.
Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us. You have become too powerful for us.” So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the valley of Gerar where he settled. Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.
Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there. But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours.” So he named the well Essek, because they disputed with him.
Marty: Alright, so he stays in the land and he’s blessed in his harvest and he’s opening wells because you have to have wells to survive and live in an area. But every time he opens wells, the locals come around, they’re like, “Those are our he knows that, “No, my dad opened these wells. These are my dad’s wells.”
They say, “No, they’re ours.” And he just says, “Okay.” And moves on to the next set of wells. And they say, “Those are our wells.” And he moves on. And we’re told that their herdsmen quarrel with Isaac’s herdsmen. Have we heard that before, Brent? Where did we hear that?
Brent: Mmm, yes. Is that, uh—is that Cain and Abel?
Marty: Not quite, but I love you’re thinking of two brothers in a field. Where were the next two brothers in a field?
Brent: Abraham and Lot?
Marty: Abraham and Lot, where he said, “you are my brother,” but he really wasn’t, but he was a brother. And that whole story was all about the herdsmen quarreling with herdsmen. So that’s an Abraham story. So this story is walking backwards through the life of his father. Isaac’s story is going backwards through the—and so you had Genesis 20 with Abimelek. Now we have Genesis 13 with the herdsmen quarreling. Let’s read the next portion. How about Genesis 26:21–25 ish?
Brent: Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also, so he named it Sidna. He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, ‘Now the Lord has given us room, and we will flourish in the land.’ From there he went up to Beersheba.
That night the Lord appeared to him and said, ‘I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham. Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.
Marty: Have we heard of anybody else who went up to Beersheba, who built an altar and called on the name of the Lord and pitched their tent? Has that been something we’ve heard about before?
Brent: That is Abraham, yes.
Marty: That is absolutely Abraham language. We are literally walking back through the life of Abraham in Isaac’s life, going right back through. Which means the first thing we encounter in Abraham’s story outside of the marriage to Yizka and Sarai is this idea of the blessing.
So we’ll have to see if that, I mean, that would be what we would expect next is the idea of blessing all nations. So give me the next little chunk here for our passage today, Brent.
Brent: Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar with Ahuzoth, his personal advisor, and Phecol the commander of his forces. Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?”
They answered, “We saw clearly that the Lord is with you, so we said there ought to be a sworn agreement between us, between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you, that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you, always treated you well and sent you away peacefully, and now you are blessed by the Lord.” Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
Marty: Alright, so now all these outsiders come out to meet with Isaac and Isaac is like, “Hey, why are you coming to me? You told me to leave. You told me to go away. You told me you didn’t want anything to do with me. I’m not trying to start anything. What’s the issue?”
And they say, “No, no, no. We have seen that God is at work with you. What we have here is we have that blessing that we started Abraham’s story with. The nations, all families of the earth are being blessed through him.
Isaac stays, he stays in the land, he stays committed to the work of Avraham, his father, and the mission is working. Like the mission is being realized. We talked about Rivka being a person committed to hospitality, being a person who cares about the outsiders.
In some way, you could say that Isaac is the outsider here, and yet he cares about others. He cares about the people that don’t belong to his tribe. He opens up wells and then suffers injustice.
Like they come and they claim that the wells are theirs, but they’re not. And Isaac doesn’t fight back. He doesn’t fight for his own rights. He submits and he blesses those that don’t even deserve it. He dies to himself.
This sounds a lot like stuff we’re going to learn in the Christian Testament, the New Testament. He dies to himself. He lets himself be taken advantage of even. And the point of this lesson is not that we should become a doormat. That’s not my point, that we should suffer at the hands of abuse. That’s not, it’s not at all my point.
This is, this is a missional choice that Isaac is making to stay in this land and to live in this land a particular way. This isn’t Isaac letting himself be abused and be a doormat. This is Isaac saying, this is what it means to bless all nations and to be on mission with God. I’m going to choose to do this because of what it can do for my neighbors.
I’m going to love my neighbor. I’m going to love even my enemies. Isaac does all these things that Jesus invites us to do. He lays his rights down. You want to take this from me? Isaac says, okay, that’s fine, because my God is generous. So I’m going to be generous. My God is open handed, so I’m going to be open handed.
And the result of this missional posture is that the outsiders come and they say, “No, no, no. We see that God was with you. What a statement. At the beginning of the chapter, it was, “You got to get out of here. We don’t want you here. You take all your stuff and you get out of town.”
By the end of the chapter, because of the way that he has lived, we see God is what the outsiders say. We see God and we see God is with you. What a stunning lesson for Isaac and the people that he lives with. I just love, and I feel like most of us, Western, if we’re American, Christians, probably have a lot to learn here because we like to feel very threatened by the culture wars.
We like to fight for our rights and feel like everybody’s, and Isaac has a very different tact with the way that he lives and moves and goes about who he is and the world around him. And it works. things that Jesus asks us to do, it works. It works in the life of Isaac. It worked in the life of the patriarchs, this radical commitment to hospitality.
Brent: And I don’t know what the actual—like, how violent was this quarrel, if at all?
Marty: Sure, sure.
Brent: Was it just like, they just walk up and like, “This is our well.” And he’s like, okay, or is there actually some fighting going on? I don’t know. But the thing with Isaac is he’s like, you know what, this is my well, and I have every right to hold on to this.
But I’ve got enough people. And if I do this right, then I can reach this whole community. And he says, intentionally, I’m not going to hold on to this. I’m going to let it go. I’m going to go do something else. And I mean, who knows if he had an expectation that this was going to happen as quickly as it did, but they sure noticed.
Marty: Well, and remember at the top of this chapter, God showed up and reminded Isaac of the mission. I wonder if he was listening. I wonder if he took it to heart. I wonder if he, I wonder if it impacted him.
He was like, that’s what you’re wanting to do through our family. That’s what you’re doing through my dad. I did see that in my dad. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, now I need to go live that out. Okay. And through the rest of the chapter, even in the midst of mistakes, just like his father makes a bunch of mistakes, but even in the midst of that, he stays committed to the mission.
I’m here to bless all families of the earth. I’m here to bless all nations. I’m gonna bless, okay, well, if I’m gonna bless all nations, I can’t stand here and argue about whose well it is. That’s not gonna help the mission. Like I wonder if that, if he was paying attention.
And I just love, it’s one, the story of Isaac is the shortest of all the patriarchs between Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph. Story of Isaac is very short. We don’t spend a lot of time in his story. There’s not a whole lot to spend time in, but Isaac is one of my favorite stories. Isaac is the generation that keeps the mission and the promise.
It was one thing to be Abraham and be the one who received the mission and the promise, but Isaac was the generation that kept the mission and the promise. And we still have generations that come after us. And it’s through those generations that come after us that we see God’s mission realized.
Makes me think of Hebrews chapter 11. The author of Hebrews is essentially saying, he’s going through this hall of faith, all different people of faith and all these different people of faith. And he says, you know, all these people didn’t receive the promise. They only saw it from a distance and they died without having received the promise. And this person was faithful and this person was faithful.
And then eventually at the end of Hebrews 11, the author says, because only together with us, it’s how these generations stack one on top of another and keep the faith. Like they demonstrate faithfulness generation after generation, that’s how their work, that’s how their faith is ultimately made perfect.
And that’s what I love about what we do. When we first recorded these episodes back in the first round of Session 1, we were recording these episodes for college students, because that’s who we work with at Impact Campus Ministries.
BEMA is pointed. We’re kind of facing directly college students, because they’re the next generation that has to figure out what faithfulness looks like, what it means to stay in the land and to live there and to live there faithfully.
You might know college students in your life that are around you. You probably don’t live far from your closest university campus. And you might have students at your church that you can share these ideas with, that you could mentor, that you could disciple. Support that generation. Encourage that generation. Cheer that generation on.
Our world is almost always full of people that are frustrated with the younger generation. Every new generation that comes, we’re frustrated because of the way they embody who they are and their desires and the way that they live in the world. But support them. Encourage them. Cheer them on. Call faithfulness out of them.
They’re going to go out and apply this mission. They’re going to realize God’s mission. in very real world scenarios. And they need to know why the things that they do with their life, not just the way that they worship God, not just the church they go to on Sunday, but everything that they do.
Like this story we’re reading about Isaac and Abraham, it’s a very, it’s a very like dirt, sweat, blood, opening wells. Like this is very material, physical shalom. This isn’t spiritual realities. This isn’t like some abstract saving souls. This is about like—their souls are being saved because of the physical story that they’re participating in.
The same is true for us, the work that we do, the businesses that we own, the way that we engage in our professions. And here are these college students going out into a world, trying hopefully to bring order to chaos, to bring shalom, and they’re going to need our encouragement.
So I would encourage you to look for those college students, look for that next generation, encourage them, disciple them, mentor them. And one of the things we haven’t really chatted about a whole lot on this podcast yet is that what we do here, the resources we create at BEMA, the work we do to try to work directly with college students, it’s all funded by donations.
We don’t monetize what we do. We don’t put advertisements in the podcast. It’s just never how we’ve wanted to do it. We could. It’s just so much better to keep this stuff clean and to keep it free and allow people to give as they feel inspired to give.
And so we’re one of those nonprofits that’s run by donations. And if you have loved the BEMA Journey, if you grow to love the BEMA Journey, if you think this is a resource that’s not just helpful, but needs to be put in the hands of young people and old alike, so that we can be a part of figuring out who this God is and what this God is doing in the world, your support makes a big, a big difference to us.
We have a lot of listeners that support us at $10 a month. And there’s so many people doing $10 a month that it’s making a huge difference. If that’s something that you could spare in your monthly budget, we’d just be, uh, very grateful and honored to have you on the team in that way.
There’s always a donate link in the show notes to every episode. And, and we won’t do this all the time, but, uh, every now and then you’ll hear us pop in here and just remind us that the work we’re trying to do and invite you to partner with us in that way. So thanks to all of you that already do.
Brent: Yeah, seriously, thank you. It’s changed my life. These lessons have meant so much to me and they have a huge effect on how I conduct myself, how I learn, how I engage with my community.
And I believed in it so much that I spent three and a half years volunteering to do the podcast and then everyone was generous and it became my job. And we’re always looking for what God is doing next when He chooses to provide that through you. So thank you from me and thank you from our entire team. It’s such a blessing.
Marty: Absolutely.
Brent: Alright, you can find more details about the show at bemadiscipleship.com. I don’t think we had any particular links for this episode, but you can always check the show notes in your podcast app as well. You can use the contact page to get in touch with us. But thanks for joining us on the BEMA Podcast this week. We’ll talk to you again soon.
Cameron: Hi, I’m Cameron, a BEMA listener in Columbus, Ohio, and here’s the prayer from Episode 12’s Companion.
Father God, may we be selfless—selfless like Rebecca, going far beyond what is required of us, even for the stranger. May we be selfless—selfless like Isaac, sacrificing what is rightfully ours, even in the face of injustice.
May we be faithful—faithful to your story, your mission, your calling—so others may be changed and souls may be saved because of the powerful, very real story we are participants in. Amen.
